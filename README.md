Project 4 for CSCI E-15

###Description of my application
I built a 5 Year Journal that was suggested as an idea from Project 4 instruction page. I followed similar 
UI as the example (http://www.levenger.com/5-year-journal-core-7150.aspx) that has one page per day, with 
5 fields for 5 years. Currently, users can input data from 2013 to 2017. The application was built 
using CodeIgniter(a PHP framework). 

###Features
- Journal for year 2013 to 2017.
- 5 years worth of journal input for the day in a page.  
- Secure private journal that requires login. It cannot be lost, seen, or accessed by other people.
- When logged in, you see the journal entry for today's date.
- Navigate to different date using the month/day input at the top of the page.

###Aspect managed by JavaScript
I implemented JavaScript to make sure the password is longer than 6 characters. 
If the character is less than 6, submit button is disabled for both registering and logging in.
